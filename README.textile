h1. GEMS:INSTALL!

_Rails: A replacement for the useless Rake task gems:install that fails to install the gems 90% of the time._

h2. How?

Detecting gem details from your environment files, and installed using the RubyGems native install command.

Together with the gem name, it also take these into account:

* @:version@ (if specified)
* @:source@ (if specified)

*Just a note:* If this task fails (which I doubt in most cases) there's most probably something wrong with the project's gem configuration, or some gem library dependencies that fails to build.

h2. Usage

<pre>
rake gems:install!
</pre>
